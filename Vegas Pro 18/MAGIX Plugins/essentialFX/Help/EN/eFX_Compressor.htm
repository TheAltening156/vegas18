 <h1 class="heading1">Compressor</h1>
<p class="bodytext">This plug-in is a simple but effective tool for reducing the dynamics of a signal. Percussion tracks may be modeled more compactly and with more pumping, vocals may be integrated into the mix better, or the entire sum or group or signals may be made denser.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In contrast to some other plug-ins, this type works the compressor with a comparatively soft curve and an adaptable regulation process, it therefore compresses completely musically. Additionally a separate input (external sidechain signal) can be defined as the regulation source.</p>

<a name="o20917"></a><h2 class="heading2">Compressor Parameter</h2>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">IN / OUT:</strong> Here you can set the input and output level.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">Internal sidechain</strong> corresponds with conventional methods; this selects the actual input signal to control the compression process.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If another track in the project triggers the compression, select <strong class="specialbold">External sidechain</strong> here. This will use a second stereo track routed to the plug-in. Make the regular adjustments in the arrangement to route the sidechain signals.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="specialbold">Note:</strong> Sidechaining is not available in some host programs.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">soft clip:</strong> Soft clip is switched on directly at the output in order to catch any overmodulations.</p>
<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">SC filter:</strong> This fader determines the application/middle frequencies, that are filtered with the control signal for level detection. The filter works selectively as a high-pass, band pass or low-pass. In many cases evaluating the detection is a good for optimizing the leveling process. So, for &nbsp;example &quot;high-pass&quot; filtering enables complex sources (drums or sum signals) to achieve consistent regulation without typical pumping artifacts, since the process is mainly activated via mids and highs. </li><li class="listbullet">Using the filter type switch the properties of the detector circle can be drastically changed. The speaker symbol is there to preview changes. </li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">Threshold: </strong> This sets the response threshold for regulation. For example, -20 dB indicates that the input/sidechain signal is only compressed once it reaches -20 dB; below this level, no change or hardly any change will take place. Note that this plug-in deals with the threshold window independent of the program. It can be the case that a small regularization has already taken place at -25dB. This so-called soft-knee characteristic ensures a soft, musical compression process.</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">Ratio: </strong> This parameter regulates the compression ratio. For example&nbsp;, a value of 10:1 means that when the threshold level is reached, the input level is increased by 10dB, while the output is only 1dB louder. A lower compression, e.&nbsp;g. 2:1, is recommended for subtle compression of group or sum signals, while 50:1 produces a very hard limiting that cannot be made inaudible by even the most transparent compressor.</li></ul><ul class="listbulletlast"><li class="listbulletlast"><strong class="specialbold">Attack &amp; release:</strong> This parameter specifies how quickly the compressor responds when the threshold is reached (attack) or how quickly the signal applies normal amplitude once the signal drops below this level (release). The transient time settings can be defined in another area. Note that due to the adaptable plug-in leveling actual times may differ. This semi-automatic process favors quick adjustment, without leading to the often dreaded artifacts (rough sound image with rushed regulation, overly low/inefficient compression with long time constants).</li></ul><p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">Tweak </strong></p>
<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">Adaptive release:</strong> With increasing values, the compressor works increasingly with &quot;Adaptive release&quot;. This means that the longer and harder the compressor intercedes upstream in the signal path, the longer is the resulting release phase.</li><li class="listbullet"> <strong class="specialbold">Auto makeup gain</strong>: Normally, you have to continuously adjust level reduction to generate &quot;compression&quot; at the same maximum level. This is done by activating auto makeup gain. The volume difference expected from the set working parameters is determined and applied as an output factor after master regulation. If you prefer to adjust the &quot;classic&quot; level reduction and amplification manually, you can deactivate this function.</li></ul><ul class="listbulletlast"><li class="listbulletlast"><strong class="specialbold">Mix:</strong> Addition of the original signals is done to get transients and spectral balance form the source. A &quot;mixed&quot; signal is particularly discreet, more transparent, and less &quot;squishy&quot; with vocals, whereby the compressed part usually has a higher level reduction than without adding the original.</li></ul><p class="bild"><img src="30453.png" vspace="0" hspace="0" align="bottom" border="0"></p>
