 <h1 class="heading1">Reverb</h1>
<p class="bodytext">This involves a completely algorithmic reverb plug-in. Selectable algorithms produce thick and extremely transparent reverberation for all kinds of signals. Processing is therefore &quot;true stereo&quot;, i.&nbsp;e. the selected algorithm includes the original localization of instruments in a stereo signal in the calculation of reverberation so that the original image will not be distorted.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&quot;Reverb&quot; features algorithms that are set up for natural quality and transparency. A signal treated with this reverb retains power at correct dosage in the overall context of the audio without perception of a conspicuous effect. The CPU load is also relatively low.</p>

<a name="o23815"></a><h2 class="heading2">Reverb parameters</h2>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">IN / OUT:</strong> Here you can set the input and output level.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">Mode:</strong> Select the desired algorithm here. The following options are available:</p>
<p class="bodytext">- <strong class="specialbold">Plate</strong>: Simulates a reverb plate. Very dense reflection pattern, penetrating but musically open &quot;metallic&quot; appeal. Very well suited to Drums and Vintage/special effects.</p>
<p class="bodytext">- <strong class="specialbold">Room</strong>: Small room reverb. Middle to high signal diffusion, low to middle reverb time. Well suited for adding a &quot;dry&quot;, natural sound to instrumental, spoken, or vocal recordings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">- <strong class="specialbold">Hall</strong>: Mid to large hall. Low to mid diffusion, later response than a &quot;Room&quot;. Ideal for simulating concert halls and larger soundscapes.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">- Plate II Classic:</strong> Classic stereo plate reverb. The design is based on an algorithm that was frequently used in the 80's. This mode produces the typical &quot;Cloud reverb&quot;, which is not very transparent, a bit sticky. Plate II Classic is a good fit for lead instruments and vocals.</p>
<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">Size: </strong> The size of the room being simulated or of the reverb plate. This setting has a direct effect on the distance of the reflection and indirectly on the resonance behavior: smaller rooms/reverb plates possess a larger inclination for natural resonance than larger ones.</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">Time: </strong> Length of reverberation time (in seconds). This value refers to the RT60 time, i.&nbsp;e. how long the reverberation requires for the level to fall 60 dB.</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">Damping: </strong> Real rooms and reverb plates dampen certain frequencies according to their construction. This is most often audible in upper frequencies. Using this parameter you can set the cut-off frequency, above which the reverb will be particularly strong. In some cases, the &quot;Time&quot; parameter should be adjusted, since sometimes the subjectively perceived reverberation time will also be affected.</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">Modulation: </strong> For several critical signals, the reverberation may produce disturbing resonance. This can be scattered by temporal modulation of the delay signal used in an algorithm. Excessive application may create an effect similar to chorus in tonal signals. The liveliness of the reverberations will be emphasized with lower values. In this case, the modulation applies a random pattern, the intensity of which may be visualized via the &quot;MOD&quot; display. </li></ul><ul class="listbulletlast"><li class="listbulletlast"><strong class="specialbold">Mix:</strong> This regulates the ratio of the unprocessed signal to the portion including reverberation.</li></ul><p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">Tweak </strong></p>
<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">Pre-delay:</strong> This knob sets time in milliseconds between the direct signal and the appearance of early reflections. The late delay comes only following this time span.</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">Diffusion:</strong> This knob simulates scatter on irregular walls in percent. Increasing values make the reverb sound denser.</li></ul><ul class="listbulletlast"><li class="listbulletlast"><strong class="specialbold">Low Cut:</strong> This knob sets the filter frequency of a high-pass filter. Signal components below this frequency will be filtered out.</li></ul><p class="bild"><img src="30451.png" vspace="0" hspace="0" align="bottom" border="0"></p>
