<p class="bodytext">Preamplifier are still used today, if the signal needs a warm, flattering sound. This is often not only about saturation or distortion artifacts, but rather more about getting a compact and more vivid sound picture. A tube stage makes things a little more dynamic, this is not due to the tubes itself, but rather the entire circuit, which interacts with the tube in a way that amplification levels don't do on a semiconducter basis. As with guitar amplifiers, the complexity increases with the number of stages.</p>
<p class="bild"><img src="29471.png" vspace="0" hspace="0" align="bottom" border="0"></p>
<p class="bodytext">Optionally inside the eFX_TubeStage plug-in, either one or two tube stages work.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Tube circuits, especially if they work in the border area and saturate/distort the signal, react very sensitively to the input signal's spectral composition.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Two independent filter circuits accompany this plug-in's tube stage (s). The first (<strong class="specialbold">pre-eq</strong>) acts directly on the input signal. With this you can determine which frequency range should be principally edited. The second filter circuit (<strong class="specialbold">post-eq</strong>) is located behind the tube stage (or after the second) and determines the tonal balance of the output signal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This enables you to create various sound nuances. For example, you can accentuate the high frequency range on the input side, for example, to create Exciter-/Enhancer effects, so that the signal appears more &quot;tangible&quot;. To avoid overemphasizing this amplified range, a reverse process with the post-EQ can be subsequently made.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Both of the available tube stages can be globally switched in the A or AB operation. In the A-circuit the entire signal runs through, as is common with simple tube preamps, through a tube. However, since these can only edit a half-wave, the working point of the circuit is set approximately in the middle of the reference line. However neither halve will ever be treated equally, so that positive displacements are amplified differently to negative displacements. (so-called Class A operation). Thereby odd and even harmonics are created. The typical 'warm' tube sound to a large extent dates back to the characteristic overtone spectrum.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For each half-wave in class-AB operation, a separate tube is used, so that in principle there is a symmetrical reinforcement. The signal contains predominantly uneven harmonics. The sound image appears thinner but more transparent and solid. This is comparable to the sound, that tape machines create when they are slightly overmodulated.</p>

<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">stages:</strong> In signal section 1 the signal only passes through the tube stages. In the second stage two stages are cascaded. This divides up the gain so that both stages are driven less 'hotly'. This increases the signal complexity and any tube artifacts.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">class A / AB</strong> Optionally, a simple gain stage with asymmetric reference line (Class A) or symmetric AB mode. In the A-mode odd and even harmonics emerge, the sound image is similar to a 'warm' tube guitar amp. In the AB section only uneven harmonics are created. The sound image is somewhat 'colder', but more transparent with complex materials and can also be driven louder.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">oversampling:</strong> If this switch is active, the virtual tube stages are controlled with one-to four-times the project sampling rate,i.e with an internal sampling rate of 176 - 192kHz.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">pre-eq:</strong> This knob (called &quot;Tilt&quot; or &quot;Level&quot; on some devices) controls the effect of a soft, passive 6 dB filter for prefiltering signals before the (first) tube stage. If turned to the left the bass is emphasized and the highs are dampened. To the right the inverted filtering happens. With this filter the signal can be correspondingly processed before &quot;Warming up&quot; by selecting the prominent of desired section. Compared to a standard EQ the effect of this filter is more subtle, but it does possess a high 'musicality', by the internal circuitry and also because of the slightly different phase response.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">gain:</strong> This set the entire amplification factor. If two two tube stages are selected using 'stages', the available Gain is divided by two and is distributed equally over both stages.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">post-eq:</strong> Operation and function like pre-eq, however, this filter is placed behind the (second) stage tube.</p>
