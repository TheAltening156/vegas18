<p class="bodytext">This plug-in combines several components in one special tool which is ideal for working with speech or vocal tracks. Virtually all recurring voice signal edits are integrated in a compact, simple interface.</p>
<p class="bild"><img src="29484.png" vspace="0" hspace="0" align="bottom" border="0"></p>
<p class="bodytext">The signal flow is set by the e_FX_VocalStrip and is directly represented by the position of the fader.</p>
<a name="o29485"></a><h2 class="heading2">Vocal Strip Parameter</h2>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">highpass:</strong> This fader determines the cut-off frequency for a steeply sloped highpass filter (24dB/Octaves) to remove part with low frequencies, such as rumbling or noises created when touching the microphone.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">gate:</strong> With gate you can attenuate the signals that fall below the threshold. Here, a smooth curve and a maximum 'softening' of up to 24dB is used to avoid hard transitions.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">DeEsser:</strong> The effect is very similar to that of the eFX_DeEsser. Here, however, the application frequency is set. The filter used in eFX_VocalStrip works in another range. The fader determines the degree of reduction.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">compression:</strong> For the most part, an eFX_Compressor component contributes to working parameters for optimizing voice recordings. The further the fader is turned the lower the threshold and higher the compression ratio. The Attack and Release times are selected according to the program.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">tone:</strong> This EQ corresponds principally to the filter network, which is also used in the eFX_TubeStage plug-in. With this you can simply and effectively calibrate the sonic balance of the voice signal, e.&nbsp;g. for better integration into the mix.</p>
