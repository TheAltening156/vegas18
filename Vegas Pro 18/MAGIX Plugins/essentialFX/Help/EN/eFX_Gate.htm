 <h1 class="heading1">Gate</h1>
<p class="bodytext">The Gate is operated in much the same way as the eFX_Compressor. In particular, the side-chain function, and selecting various filter types can be also be applied here.</p>
<p class="bild"><img src="29474.png" vspace="0" hspace="0" align="bottom" border="0"></p>
<p class="bodytext">The operation is similar to a classic analog gate. Here emphasis was placed on a fast and accurate response, where the typical artifacts from digital gates such as rough, &quot;fluttering&quot; sounds are avoided. The essential FX Gate continuously scans the signal and automatically selects optimal settings according to the current values??.</p>
<a name="o29475"></a><h2 class="heading2">Gate parameter</h2>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">IN / OUT:</strong> Here you can set the input and output level.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">sidechain int/ext:</strong> As with eFX_Compressor an external control input can be used for triggering.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="specialbold">Note:</strong> Sidechaining is not available in some host programs.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">soft knee:</strong> Normally the Gate has a hard characteristic i.&nbsp;e. below the threshold this signal is markedly, in addition it is transmitted in an unchanged form. &quot;Hard Knee&quot; deals with abrupt transitions. &quot;Soft Knee&quot;, however, allows the signal to be modified by &quot;Gating&quot; in the pass and, so that transitions can be made to be more soft and undetectable. This is particularly recommendable for work with acoustic instruments such as drums where the signal levels can fluctuate a lot.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">hold:</strong> This three-way switch controls how long the gate process waits after passing through the attack phase before subsequently passing through the Release phase. The Hold Function is useful for signals that need a rather short release time, but shouldn't be flattened out.</p>
<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">sc filter:</strong> The control corresponds to the essentialFX Compressor.</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">threshold:</strong> This fader defines the threshold beneath which the gate should be initiated.</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">range:</strong> Here you can set the Gating strength. Right extreme means that the signal beneath the threshold is cut out completely. Subtly attenuating the signal can &nbsp;remove background noises or breathing from vocal tracks. Where necessary the process can be attenuated even further by switching on the soft knee mode.</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">attack:</strong> Regulates the attack time from the closed gate to the point at which signal is let through again.</li></ul><ul class="listbulletlast"><li class="listbulletlast"><strong class="specialbold">release:</strong> Sets the time, that the gate requires to go from a normal state to gating.</li></ul><p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">Tweak </strong></p>
<ul class="listbulletlast"><li class="listbulletlast"><strong class="specialbold">Look Ahead:</strong> This control sets how long ahead the gate previews the signal. The audio signal will be delayed by this time.</li></ul><p class="bild"><img src="30457.png" vspace="0" hspace="0" align="bottom" border="0"></p>
