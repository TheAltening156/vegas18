<p class="bodytext">The stereo delay is a simple too for typical bread and butter delay effects. The stereo delay offers the &quot;analog algorithm&quot;, which features the sound of echo devices of yesteryear.</p>

<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">Digital:</strong> Normal, transparent delay</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">Analog:</strong> Simulation of a bucket brigade delay (BBD). These devices, which originate from the pre-digital era, used analog building blocks for storage. The signal was held for a short time in a relatively simple circuit and then moved on to the next. This &quot;bucket brigade&quot; principle created a longer signal delay. But since each element of the chain led to a loss of the signal and would increase the system noise with longer delays, the devices would use a compander: At the input, the signal's dynamics are compressed, and then they are expanded again at the output end. The simulation in the eFX_delay mimics the loss and compander behavior to produce these typical audio characteristics, especially at longer delay periods and higher repetition rates (feedback).</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">delay L/delay R:</strong> Specify the delay period for the left and right channels here.</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">tempo sync:</strong> If this button is active, the plug-in is directed at the host/sequencer tempo. In this mode, changes are made to the delay period via the L/R delay using the musical snap grid (e.&nbsp;g. 1/4 note).</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">damping:</strong> This specifies the cut-off frequency at which the highs are dampened during the delay. This useful for making the delays reverberate more naturally or for creating special effects (reggae/dub-style effects).</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">feedback:</strong> This parameter regulates the internal amplitude of the delayed signal that is fed back to the input. In &quot;Digital&quot; mode, this process is completely transparent; in &quot;Analog&quot;, on the other hand, higher values, a very loud input signal, or the sum of these will make the use of dynamics compression audible. In both modes, the nullification of the feedback parameter is in the center of the fader. To the right, the plug-in works in &quot;Dual delay&quot; mode (both sides work independently), and to the left, &quot;Ping pong&quot; mode will be activated (the delayed signal alternates between the left and right sides).</li><li class="listbullet"><strong class="specialbold">mix:</strong> Regulates the mix ratio of the original signal and the delayed portion.</li></ul>
