<div class=subhead>1.0 Welcome<a NAME=Welcome></a></div>


<div>Thank you for purchasing VEGAS Creative Software Video Capture 
  6.0 software. This document contains information 
  about installing and using Video Capture software on your computer.</div>

                        <ul type="square">
                    <li>To prevent dropped frames, do not use your computer for 
                      any other process while capturing or printing to tape. .</li>
                    <li>Capturing to the same hard drive where your operating 
                      system is installed can result in dropped frames. If you 
                      have more than one drive, you can specify the target drive 
                      on the Disk Management tab of the Preferences dialog.</li>
                    <li>To prevent dropped frames, defragment the drive to which 
                      you will be capturing video.</li>
                    <li>If you will be recapturing your video from DV tape in 
                      the future, select the <strong>Stop capture on dropped frames</strong> 
                      check box on the Capture tab of the Preferences dialog. 
                      This will ensure that the original captures and subsequent 
                      recaptures are identical.</li>
                    <li>OHCI-compliant IEEE-1394 DV capture cards are required 
                      for DV device control.</li>
                    <li>Even if device control does not work, you may still be 
                      able to capture video by manually controlling your video 
                      device (e.g. pressing play on your camcorder's remote and 
                      then clicking the <strong>Capture</strong> button in Video 
                      Capture). If you are having capture problems, try clearing 
                      the<strong> Enable DV device control</strong> check box 
                      in the Preferences dialog.</li>
                    <li>Not all analog capture cards are supported at this time. 
                      If you're using an analog card, please obtain the latest 
                      WDM (Windows Driver Model) or VFW (Video for Windows) drivers 
                      from your hardware manufacturer.</li>
                    <li>If your DV camera is connected to another IEEE-1394 device 
                      (&quot;daisy-chained&quot;), the bandwidth of the IEEE-1394 
                      channel may not be sufficient for print-to-tape operations. 
                      Connect each device to its own IEEE-1394 port before using 
                      print-to-tape.</li>
                    <li>When using a digital-to-analog transcoder without a LANC 
                      adapter connected, clear the <strong>Enable DV device control</strong> 
                      check box on the General Preferences tab.</li>
                    <li>If you experience audio and video synchronization problems 
                      when previewing from an analog device, choose Preview Audio 
                      from the Options menu to turn off audio preview. Use the 
                      Windows mixer to control the volume of the input to which 
                      your capture card's audio output is connected.</li>
                    <li>If you experience degraded system performance, clear the 
                      <strong>Enable still image capture</strong> check box on 
                      the Capture tab of the Preferences dialog.</li>
                    <li>If you experience problems using a TV tuner card or displaying 
                      closed captioning, clear the <strong>Enable still image 
                      capture</strong> check box on the Capture tab of the Preferences 
                      dialog.</li>
                    <li>When the <strong>Allow full-screen file playback via Preview 
                      on Camera or Print to Tape</strong> check box is selected 
                      on the Capture tab of the Preferences dialog, the audio 
                      and video output is not sent to connected DV devices.</li>
                    <li>When the <strong>Allow full-screen file playback via Preview 
                      on Camera or Print to Tape</strong> check box is selected, 
                      you may have to play and stop previewing before the video 
                      preview is displayed in full-screen mode. Contact your hardware 
                      manufacturer for updated drivers, or &#8212; if you're using 
                      a Matrox DualHead display adapter &#8212; turn off dual-monitor 
                      support.</li>
                    <li>To prevent duplicated timecode from occurring on DV tapes, 
                      pre-stripe the tape by recording over the entire tape with 
                      the lens cap on, or ensure you start recording before the 
                      end of the previous scene.</li>
                    <li>If you're unable to preview an MJPEG-encoded file to an 
                      MJPEG external monitor, select the <strong>Close current 
                      device when in file playback mode </strong>check box on 
                      the General tab of the Preferences dialog.</li>
                    <li>If you experience unexpected rebooting and are using a 
                      debug version of the DirectX 8 runtime, please upgrade to 
                      the retail version of the DirectX 8 runtime.</li>                    
                    <li>Depending on your current time ruler format, you may see 
                      inconsistencies in the timecode values for clips that you 
                      captured. Video Capture uses SMPTE drop time (29.97 fps). 
                      If you switch the time format in VEGAS Pro to use SMPTE drop 
                      time, Video Capture and VEGAS Pro will display the same timecode 
                      information. </li>
